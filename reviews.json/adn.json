        "text": "I found a lot of this book incredibly tedious. I tend to avoid the winners of the Man / Booker \u2013 they make me a little depressed. The only Carey I haven\u2019t liked won the Booker (Oscar and Lucinda), I really didn\u2019t like the little bit ofVernon God LittleI read and I never finishedThe Seadespite really liking Banville\u2019s writing. So, being told a book is a winner of the Booker tends to be a mark against it from the start, unfortunately.I\u2019m going to have to assume you have read this book, as if I don\u2019t I won\u2019t be able to say anything about it at all. Apparently, when Yann Martel wrote this he was feeling a bit down and this was his way of plucking himself up. Well, good on him. That\u2019s just great. I was a little annoyed when I found out that the person the book is dedicated to had also written a story about a man in a boat with a wild cat and had considered suing for plagiarism.The book is written by a member of that class of people who are my least favourite; a religious person who cannot conceive of someone not being religious. There is some fluff at the start in which atheism is \u2018discussed\u2019 (read, discarded) as something people inevitably give up on with their dying breath. But the religious are generally terribly arrogant, so it is best not to feel insulted by their endless insults \u2013 they know not what they do.Parts of this were so badly over written that it was almost enough to make me stop reading. The bit where he is opening his first can of water is a case in point. This takes so long and is so incidental to the story and written in such a cutesy way that I started to pray the boat would sink, the tiger would get him \u2026 I would even have accepted God smiting him at this point as a valid plotting point, even if (or particularly because) it would bring the story to an abrupt end.This is a book told as two possible stories of how a young man survives for 227 days floating across the Pacific Ocean told in 100 chapters. That was the other thing that I found annoying \u2013 much is made of the fact this story is told in 100 chapters \u2013 but I could not feel any necessity for many of the chapters. Just as I could not feel any necessity for the Italic voice that sounded like Tom Waits doing, \u201cWhat is he building in there?\u201d Well, except to introduce us again to Pi some number of years later. You know, inInvisible CitiesCalvino has necessary chapters \u2013 this book just has 100 chapters. It was something that annoyed me from early on in the book \u2013 that the chapters seemed far too arbitrary and pointing it out at the end just made me more irritated. There may well be some Hindu reason for 100 chapters \u2013 but like Jesus ticking off the ancient prophecies on his way to martyrdom, I still couldn\u2019t see why these chapters were needed in themselves.Pi is the central character in the book who, for some odd reason, is named after a swimming pool \u2013 I started playing with the ideas of swimming pools and oceans in my head to see where that might lead, but got bored. He is an active, practicing member of three of the world\u2019s major religions. There is a joke in the early part of the book about him possibly becoming Jewish (ha ha \u2013 or perhaps I should draw a smiley face?). The only religion missing entirely from the book is Buddhism. Well, when I say entirely, it is interesting that it is a Japanese ship that sinks and that the people Pi tells his story to are Japanese engineers. I\u2019ve known Hindus who consider Buddhists to be little more than dirty, filthy atheists \u2013 so perhaps that is one reason why these Japanese engineers are treated with such contempt at the end of the book.The Japanese make the connections between the two stories \u2013 but we can assume that they stuff up these connections. While it is clear the French Cook is the hyena, Pi\u2019s mum is the orang-utang, and the Asian gentleman is the zebra, I\u2019m not convinced Pi is meant to be the tiger. In fact, the one constant (that\u2019s a pun, by the way, you are supposed to be laughing) in both stories in Pi.My interpretation is that the tiger is actually God. Angry, jealous, vicious, hard to appease, arbitrary and something that takes up lots of time when you have better things to do \u2013 sounds like God to me.The last little bit of the book has Pi asking which is the better story- the one with animals or the one he tells with people. I mean, this is an unfair competition \u2013 he has spent chapter after chapter telling the animal story and only the last couple telling the people story. The point of this, though, is Pascal\u2019s wager said anew. If we can never really know if there is no god and it ultimately makes no difference if we tell the story with him or without him in it, but if the story is more beautiful with him in it \u2013 then why not just accept him in the story and be damned.Well, because the story isn\u2019t improved with the animals and life isn\u2019t just a story and kid\u2019s stories are great sometimes, but I often like adult stories at least as much \u2013 and sometimes even more.This is yet another person all alone survival story, but one I don\u2019t feel that was handled as well as it could have been \u2013 mostly because the writer had an ideological message that he felt was more important than the story \u2013 never a good sign. Worse still, in the end I really couldn\u2019t care less about Pi \u2013 I knew he was going to survive and knew it would be \u2018because of\u2019 his faith.He does talk about Jesus\u2019 most petulant moment with the fig tree \u2013 so I was quite impressed that rated a mention \u2013 but, all the same, I haven\u2019t been converted to any or all of the world religions discussed in this book.Compare this tale with the bit out ofA History of the World in Ten and a Half Chaptersabout the painting \u2013 I know, it is not a fair comparison, Barnes is a god, but I\u2019ve made it anyway.I didn\u2019t really enjoy this book, I felt it tried too hard and didn\u2019t quite make it. But Christians will love it \u2013 oh yeah \u2013 Christians will definitely love it."

        "text": "It is not so much that The Life of Pi, is particularly moving (although it is). It isn\u2019t even so much that it is written with language that is both delicate and sturdy all at once (which it is, as well). And it\u2019s certainly not that Yann Martel\u2019s vision filled passages are so precise that you begin to feel the salt water on your skin (even though they are). It is that, like Bohjalian and Byatt and all of the great Houdini\u2019s of the literary world, in the last few moments of your journey \u2013 after you\u2019ve felt the emotions, endured the moments of heartache, yearned for the resolution of the characters\u2019 struggle \u2013 that you realize the book is not what you thought it was. The story transforms, instantly, and forever.And in those last few chapters, you suddenly realize that the moral has changed as well.You feel Martel\u2019s words lingering, suggesting, and you find yourself wondering whether you are his atheist who takes the deathbed leap of faith \u2013 hoping for white light and love? Or the agnostic who , in trying to stay true to his reasonable self, explains the mysteries of life and death in only scientific terms, lacking imagination to the end, and, essentially, missing the better story?There is no use in trying to provide a brief synopsis for this ravishing tale of a young boy from India left adrift in the Pacific in a lifeboat with a tiger who used to reside in his father\u2019s zoo in Pondicherry. There is no use because once you finish the book you might decide that this was not, indeed, what the book was about at all. There is no use because, depending on your philosophical bent, the book will mean something very different to your best friend than it will to you. There is no use because it is nearly impossible to describe what makes this book so grand.Read this book. Not because it is an exceptional piece of literary talent. It is, of course. But there are many good authors and many good books. While uncommon, they are not endangered. Read this book because in recent memory - aside from Jose Saramago\u2019s arresting Blindness \u2013 there have been no stories which make such grand statements with such few elements. As Pi says in his story \u201cLife on a lifeboat isn\u2019t much of a life. It is like an end game in chess, a game with few pieces. The elements couldn\u2019t be more simple, nor the stakes higher.\u201d It is the same with Martel\u2019s undulating fable of a book about a boy in a boat with a tiger. A simple story with potentially life altering consequences for it\u2019s readers.As Martel writes, \"The world isn't just the way it is. It is how we understand it, no? And in understanding something, we bring something to it, no?\" Like Schroedinger's cat in the box, the way this book is understood, the way it is perceived affects what it is. There has been some talk that this book will make it\u2019s readers believe in god. I think it\u2019s a question of perspective. To behold this gem of a novel as an adventure of man against the elements (the \u201cdry, yeastless factuality\u201d of what actually happened) is certainly one way to go about it. But to understand this piece to be something indescribable, something godlike, is by far the greater leap of faith.Oh, but worth the leap, if the reader is like that atheist, willing to see the better story."

        "text": "I wasextremelysurprised by this book. Let me tell you why (it's a funny story):On the Danish cover it says \"Pi's Liv\" (Pi's Life), but I hadn't noticed the apostrophe, so I thought it said \"Pis Liv\" (Piss Life) and I thought that was an interesting title at least, so perhaps I should give it a go. So I did. And... what I read was not at all what I had expected (I thought it was a book about a boy growing up amidst poverty and homelessness). It wasn't until I looked up the book in English I realized the title wasn't \"Piss Life\". I was deceived for longer than I like to admit and, well, not only about this.When I first read it I also thought it was based on a true story. I'm not sure why I thought this, I must have misread something (I vaguely recall thinking the prologue was instead an introduction). It was a sad (and ehm, slightly humiliating) day when I discovered the truth lay elsewhere. I guess your romantic beliefs must die someday, and that was the day for me.See, it's easier to believe in the world and be optimistic about it, when you also believe that world capable of containing a boy and a tiger co-existing on a lifeboat for 7 months andsurviving.The truth is this book probably changed my life, not in any grand, extraordinary way. But with the small things, the small observations. Like how Pi was afraid to run out of paper, to document his days in the lifeboat, and instead he ran out of ink. Like how he chose to embrace three religions, not just one.This book, and Pi especially, represent and embody a way of life that I admire. It's not about believing in God, but about what it takes to believe insomething, anything really. Yourself, the world, goodness, life, God.If it seemed real enough for me to believe it had happened, perhaps the real world is indeed a place where itcouldhappen. And that's what I want to believe, even if real life might tell me otherwise."

Tiger turds do NOT taste good, no mater how hungry you are and hold absolutely no nutritional value (actualy this might apply only to turds obtained from tigers that have been floating on rafts for several weeks/months? I think I'll apply it as a general rule).I wanted to like this book more - I loved the cover and then there's that little golden seal that keeps going psst, psst, you don't get it - it's waaaay deep, you missed the whole point. But I think no, I got the point, like a 2 by 4 to the forehead I got the dang point!What I lack in spelling, this author lacks in subtlty. I felt like the ending was a study guide/cliff notes pamphlet/wikepedia entry all in one.I love Pi in the first 3rd, I understand the merits of Pi in the raft (just not my thing), but pi in the last bit - ugh, ugh,ugh! I'm chocking on the authors shoving of moral down my throat - help! help! I can't breath.......2 stars for the beginning, negative 3 stars for the ending, add something (or subtract to make it equal a positive - ????) and there you have my 2 starred LIfe of Pi review."

But are they worth it?Click the linkfor my video review of the big bois in my life.The Written Review:The beginning is rough.It's all like - Why do we keep going on and on about religion? Where's the boat? Where's the tiger?Stop and enjoy the roses.The book will get to the tiger part when it wants to.Young Pi ( Piscine \"Pi\" Patel ) spends the first part of the book joiningthe Christian, Muslim and Hindu faiths.It's not a matter of he can't choose a religion - it's that he is able simultaneously believe in all of them.Thephilosophical musings and religious proseprovide an extremely interesting insight on how these religions intersect:If Christ spent an anguished night in prayer, if He burst out from the Cross, 'My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?' then surely we are also permitted doubt. But we must move on. To choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation.And then...you get to the tiger part!Pi Patel's life quickly shifts from one of religious philosophy and animal care (at his family's zoo) to one of great uncertainty.His family is closing their Indian zooand they need to travel by boat to a new county. Whatever animals they couldn't sell or trade are on the ship.Only, something goes wrong.Very. Wrong.Theship is capsizingand it looks like neither human nor animal will make it out alive.Soon, Pi finds himself on a lifeboat with a menagerie of animals and within an adventure he will surely never forget.Dare I say I miss him? I do. I miss him. I still see him in my dreams. They are nightmares mostly, but nightmares tinged with love. Such is the strangeness of the human heart.Note:Was I the only one who wasupset with the ending?I was so mad that we were given the two scenarios at the end of the story. It was like the rug was being pulled out from under me.According to Pi, either we are to believe the tiger adventure happened or it was the alternate version: cannibalism and watching his family die in the boat.I felt cheated and turned what was a huge triumphant moment into a truly giant downer.Four stars because I have a selective memory and overall enjoyed the book.YouTube|Blog|Instagram|Twitter|Facebook| Snapchat @miranda_reads"

        "text": "Life of Pi was a fairly engaging story in terms of plot and character, but what made it such a memorable book, for me at least, was its thematic concerns. Is it a \"story that will make you believe in God,\" as Pi claims? I'm not sure I'd go that far, but I would recommend it to people who enjoy thinking about the nature of reality and the role of faith in our lives.To me, the entire thrust of the book is the idea that reality is a story, and therefore we can choose our own story (as the author himself puts it). So if life is a story, we have two basic choices: we can limit ourselves only to what we can know for sure - that is, to \"dry, yeastless factuality\" - or we can choose \"the better story.\" I suppose in Pi's world the \"better story\" includes God, but he doesn't say this is the only meaningful possibility. In fact, Pi calls atheists his \"brothers and sisters of a different faith,\" because, like Pi, atheists \"go as far as the legs of reason will carry them - and then they leap.\"Pi's point, in my opinion, is that human experience always involves interpretation, that our knowledge is necessarily limited, that both religious belief and atheism require a leap of faith of one kind or another - after all, there's so little we can know for sure. For Pi, then, we shouldn't limit ourselves only to beliefs that can be proven empirically. Instead, we should make choices that bring meaning and richness to our lives; we should exercise faith and strive for ideals (whatever the object of our faith and whatever those ideals might be). Or, as Pi says in taking a shot at agnosticism: \"To choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation.\"In the end, however, I didn't necessarily read this book as an invitation to believe in God. Instead, I saw it as a mirror held up to the reader, a test to see what kind of worldview the reader holds. That is, as Pi himself says, since \"it makes no factual difference to you and you can't prove the question either way, which story do you prefer? Which is the better story, the story with the animals or the story without the animals?\" Or, as I took it: Is it my nature to reach for and believe the better but less likely story? Or do I tend to believe the more likely but less lovely story? What view of reality do I generally hold?Another equally important question is this: How did I come by my view of reality? Do I view the world primarily through the lens of reason? Or do I view it through the lens of emotion? For Pi, I think it's safe to say his belief comes by way of emotion. He has, as one reviewer noted, a certain skepticism about reason (in fact, Pi calls it \"fool's gold for the bright\"). Pi also has what I would call a subtle but real basis for his belief in God, namely, \"an intellect confounded yet a trusting sense of presence and ultimate purpose.\" But belief still isn't easy for him. Despite his trusting sense of purpose, Pi acknowledges that \"Love is hard to believe, ask any lover. Life is hard to believe, ask any scientist. God is hard to believe, ask any believer.\" So it's not that a life of faith is easier, in Pi's opinion, it's that for him belief is ultimately more worthwhile.This is not to say, however, that Pi holds a thoroughly postmodern view of God or that he believes as a matter of art rather than in a sincere way. True, Pi suggests that whether you believe his story had a tiger in it is also a reflection of your ability to believe in something higher. And of course it's easy to read Pi's entire story as an attempt to put an acceptable gloss on a horrific experience. Still, there are a number of clues throughout the book that give the reader at least some reason to believe Pi's story did have a tiger in it (for instance, the floating banana and the meerkat bones).As such, Pi's two stories could be seen as an acknowledgement that both atheism and belief in God require some faith, and therefore it's up to each of us to choose the way of life that makes us the happiest. He's not necessarily saying that the truth is what you make it, he's saying we don't have unadulterated access to the truth: our imagination, personalities, and experiences unavoidably influence the way we interact with the world. But that's not the same as saying whatever we imagine is true. I think Pi, for instance, knows which of his stories is true. It's not Pi but the reader who is left with uncertainty and who therefore has to throw her hands up and say \"I don't know,\" or else choose one story or the other. And to me, this isn't too far off from the predicament we all find ourselves in.And that's what makes Life of Pi such a challenge to the reader: Pi's first story is fantastic, wonderful, but hard to believe. Yet there's some evidence that it happened just the way he said it did. And Pi's second story is brutal, terrible, but much easier to accept as true. Yet it's not entirely plausible either, and it leaves no room for the meerkat bones or Pi's \"trusting sense of presence and ultimate purpose.\" If the reader personally dismisses the tiger story out of hand, I suppose that's another way of saying the reader, by nature, tends to believe the more likely but less lovely story. In the same way, if the reader gets to the story's payoff and still believes there was a tiger in the boat, the reader is probably inclined to believe the more emotionally satisfying story. But it should be born in mind that Pi doesn't definitively state which story was true, something which only he can know for sure. All we can really be sure of, in Pi's universe, is that he was stuck on a lifeboat for a while before making it to shore. So which story do I believe? I struggled with that question for a long time. But after thinking about it for a couple of days, I'll end this review with the final lines from the book: \"Very few castaways can claim to have survived so long at sea as Mr. Patel, and none in the company of an adult Bengal Tiger.\""

        "text": "I read this book two years ago, but when we discussed it this month for book club, I remembered how much I liked it. A good discussion always ups my appreciation of a novel as does an ending that makes me requestion my givens in the story. I find myself reading contradictory interpretations and agreeing with both sides. That's the beauty of symbolism: as long as you back up your cause, it's plausible.Initially it took me several weeks to get into the book. The beginning reads more like a textbook with inserted clips of the main character's future self. While the knowledge I gained about zoology and theology was interesting, it wasn't intriguing enough to keep me awake for more than a few pages at a time and often I found the tidbits a confusing distraction. But with distance I enjoyed the backdrop information it offered. If you're struggling through the initial background, jump ahead to the second section. Yeah it's important, but it's not vital. And maybe once you've read the story you'll want to come back and appreciate his analysis.I highly enjoyed this strange journey at sea and found it almost believable--until the castaways encounter the island at which point I wondered how much of his sanity wavered. Being shipwreck is one of a plethora of phobias I have. Throw on top my even stronger fear of tigers and this was a story straight out of a nightmare, one that kept me intrigued for a resolution. How could a boy keep the upper hand shipwrecked with a tiger? I had a picture in my head of Pi clinging to the side of the boat to avoid both the salty water infested with sharks and a foodless boat housing a hungry carnivore.I found myself stuck in the unusual place where as a reader I find a story plausible with full knowledge that had this story been presented in real life I would have doubted its authenticity. I wanted to believe the story and all its fantasy. The end initially annoyed me, but if you look at the rich metaphors in the story, it becomes delectable for a story analyst like me. There is nothing I enjoy more than tearing apart a story and pulling out the intentions and symbols buried inside. Instead of just a fantastical story, you find a fable with a moral.Spoilers here.I want to reread the story now and analyze Richard Parker as Pi's alter ego, seeing that alpha and omega struggle as an internal one. Even the name Richard Parker is a hint at cannibalistic roots since it is the true account of a sailor who died at the hands of his cannibalistic crew members. I keep going back to that moment when Pi calls for Richard Parker to join him on the ship and then is appalled at what he has done. Once Richard Parker has joined his voyage, there is no banishing him. If they are one and the same, they beautifully represent that internal battle between the civilized vegetarian and the animalistic instinct to survive, showing the compartmentalization he needed to prevent madness.You would not expect the small boy to conquer the beast (whether animal or himself), and yet he keeps the upper hand for an unimaginable 227 days. Had the cannibal overrun his pysche, he would have lost his battle and landed a madman. When the duo landed on the beaches of Mexico, Richard Parker took off, never to be noted by civilians again, but alive and surviving. Thus the horror of the incident will always live in Pi's memory but he chooses to repress it as it has no part in civilization.I enjoyed the portrayal of the characters on the boat as animals. I could envision the quiet maternal sadness the orangutan gave his mother. Since the crew would be blamed for the demise of the ship, the wounded sailor as the zebra lying as prey to a demented and angry foreign chef who is just as crazy as we view the viscous hyena. The symbols were perfect and I think a second read would bring out their traits even stronger.Some of the richest symbolism comes from the cannibal island and sailor. I think Pi's childlike mind could not deal with the cannibalism of a loved one and lets this theme leak into other story elements. The blind sailor is a second portrayal of the French chef, a character too big and conflicting to fit into one projection. At first he is the mean animal thinking only of his own survival, but as the journey progresses, Pi is conflicted with his friendship for the man. A bond is bound to happen between the only two survivors in limited space and Pi could not come to terms with his human feelings for the barbaric man. So he invents a second character, one whom he can make human, worthy of connection, but in the end is still untrustworthy and Pi must kill or be killed.So what of the strange island? In his hallucinating state, it serves as a mirage where life is not as sweet as he suspected. The island parallels his own problems at sea with rich religious symbolism of the Garden of Eden. No matter what one's ethical code, the will to survive trumps one's moral haven. These vegetarians (person and island) don't want to harm, but are killing to survive. Something happened out at sea that his waning mind (and blindness both real and spiritual) could not substantiate and like all else he twisted it to a socially accepted tale. Since the island is discovered just after the sailor dies, maybe finding one of the chef's tooth on board turned him. Or maybe Pi happened upon a pile of garbage infested with rats and this boy, starving and demented enough to have tried his own waste, sees it as a heaven. His civilized nature knew he should scorn the filth but his barbaric needs were grateful for the nasty feast. The bones in the boat, proof that his experience was real, could have been rat bones.Whatever the cause of his epiphany, he had to enter the depths of his own personal hell to realize this was not a heaven, or Garden of Eden, and a return to civilized behavior was vital for his own survival. Richard Parker was winning as he felt completely detached from civilization. He almost wished to stay and die at sea, to live at a level of base survival, instead of have to emotionally deal with his ordeal to progress. But his innate need to survive wins out as he realizes that as the lone castaway if he does not fight his mind's descent into madness, the sea will eat him mentally and literally.One of my favorite interpretations of the island is a religious fork in the road. Whatever truly happened, the island cements your belief in the first or second account. Either you see the meerkat remains as proof that the beauty of the first story is true or the island is the point at which you start questioning the credence of his tale and believe he threw in this unbelievable turn of events to ready you to accept his alternate ending. As readers we are given the choice between two stories. We can pick the miraculous version of the first story, an icon of those who believe in God, or we can pick the grim atheist view of the pessimistic--although reasonable--second story, as do those who believe science disproofs God. In section one, Pi references religion to not only show where his beliefs give him strength but to give backbone to the religious allegory. He shows disdain for the indecisive agnostic (see quotes below) and bids you chose your path. The island serves to question your own religious devotion, but you have to pick what you think it represents, which story you care to believe.Pi states this is a story that makes you believe in God. As a believer in Godandthe second story, I don't think there is merely an atheist interpretation to the second. Either you accept God with a leap of faith despite dissenting controversy or you take the bleak realism and see God saved him from death at sea and even more protected him from mental anguish by healing his soul from the horrors he experienced. Both stories can justify the belief in God or justify your belief in nothing. Just as I don't believe people who buy the second story are atheists, I do not believe people who chose the first story follow blindly or idiotically. It's a matter of interpretation. The story isn't going to make you believe or disbelieve God anymore than you now do.At first I was annoyed he recanted his story because I wanted to believe his original story. It is imaginative and well written and I didn't like being called out for believing fantasy from the fantasy itself. But how could I not love an allegorical explanation to a literal story? So now I love that he presents both stories: the imaginative far-fetched one and the plausible horrific one and leaves you the reader to decide which one you want to buy into and let you ponder what it says about you. That is the point of the story.Some of my favorite quotes from the book:\"Life is so beautiful that death has fallen in love with it, a jealous, possessive love that grabs at what it can.\"\"It was my luck to have a few good teachers in my youth, men and women who came into my dark head and lit a match.\"\"Doubt is useful for a while...But we must move on. To choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation.\"\"All living things contain a measure of madness that moves them in strange, sometimes inexplicable ways.\"\"Memory is an ocean and he bobs on the surface.\"\"First wonder goes deepest; wonder after that fits in the impression made by the first.\"\"The main battlefield for good is not the open ground of the public arena but the small clearing of each heart.\""

But this story is one that I will carry with me.Life of Pi starts in India with a boy named Piscine Molitor Patel, also known by his nickname Pi. His family historically has operated a zoo but decides to relocate to Canada. Things don\u2019t go quite as expected when the ship carrying them to Canada sinks.Pi spends 227 days searching for land with a tiger named Richard Parker.Parallels to Real LifeDid you know that Jose Salvador Alvarenga was adrift for 438 days at sea? He went fishing off the coast of Mexico on November 17, 2012. After drifting for more than a year, he spotted Marshall Islands and swam to shore.Deep QuestionsThere were some really interesting questions that are raised in the Life of Pi:What gets you up in the morning? What wakes you up out of your bed and inspires you to put one foot in front of the other, to make this existence meaningful and worthwhile? What is your tiger?Why are the stories that we tell ourselves important?Book Versus MovieAs someone who has both read the book and viewed the movie, I would recommend reading the book before watching the movie. However, both are excellent, and I really enjoyed the vibrant, rich colors in the movie.Overall, an unforgettable book that will always make me think twice before boarding a boat. Now, I just need to find a cat to adopt and name him Richard Parker\u2026\u2026.Connect With Me!BlogTwitterBookTubeFacebookInsta"

        "text": "No need to reinvent the wheel. Here's my Amazon.com review:It doesn't matter whether what you tell people is truth or fiction, because there's no such thing as truth, no real difference between fantasy and reality, so you might as well go with the more interesting story. That's \"Life of Pi\" in a nutshell. Sorry to spoil it for anyone who hasn't read it yet.Remember that season of the TV series \"Dallas\" that turned out to be just a dream? That's kind of how you feel after you've invested hours of your time reading page after page of a quite engrossing survival narrative, only to find out that it was all something the survivor made up.Or was it? Ah, there's the twist that we're supposed to find so clever. But the officials from the ship company who tell Pi they don't believe his story are such hopelessly weak strawmen that the author pretty much forces you to accept the \"better story.\" Pi, and, by extension, Martel, have no patience for the \"dry, yeastless factuality\" that the ship officials want, you see. Never mind whether it's closer to the truth -- it's just too boring, and we need colorful stories to make our lives richer. Besides, Pi and Martel say, as soon as something leaves your mouth, it's no longer reality -- it's only your interpretation of reality. So why bother grasping for the truth? You prefer the Creation story to the Big Bang? Then go with the Creation story, even if it defies logic and scientific discovery.That's all well and good. Everyone likes a good story. But there's a time and a place for them, and the ship officials didn't need a story -- they needed to know what happened to their ship. To that end, Pi's entire tale is irrelevant anyway. And that, in turn, makes you wonder what the whole point of the book was. Other than, maybe, to laud the power of storytelling in a really hamfisted manner. Or to advocate for taking refuge in fantastical fiction when reality is too harsh. Or to champion shallow religious beliefs (\"Why, Islam is nothing but an easy sort of exercise, I thought. Hot-weather yoga for the Bedouins. Asanas without sweat, heaven without strain.\"). Or to bash agnostics. Or something.Be advised that this is not a book for children or the squeamish. Pi's transformation from vegetarian to unflinching killer, and Richard Parker's dietary habits, are rife with gratuituously gory details about the manner in which animals suffer and are killed and eaten.The story promises to make you believe in God. Yet with Martel's insistence that a well-crafted story is just as good as or even preferable to reality, he leaves us not believing in a god of any kind, but rather suggesting that we embrace the stories that religions have made up about their gods, regardless of those stories' relation to scientific knowledge, since the stories are so darn nice, comfy, warm, and fuzzy in comparison with real life. Whether the God in the stories actually exists, meanwhile, becomes totally irrelevant. So ultimately, Martel makes a case for why he thinks people SHOULD believe in God -- it's a respite from harsh reality, we're told, a way to hide from life rather than meet it head-on with all of its pains and struggles -- and that's quite different from what he ostensibly set out to do. He trivializes God into a \"nice story,\" a trite characterization sure to offend many readers.Pi sums up this postmodern worldview by telling the ship investigators, \"The world isn't just the way it is. It is how we understand it, no?\" Well, no, the world IS just the way it is, in all of its highs and lows, triumphs and tragedies, happiness and sadness. But Pi and Martel's solution is to avoid the whole messy thing altogether, pretend that the way things are don't really exist, and pull a security blanket of fiction over your head. Create your own reality as you see fit. That's called escapism. It's fine when you want to curl up with a good book on a rainy day and get lost in the story for a few hours, but it's a lousy way to try to deal with real life.Pi would tell me that I lack imagination, just as he told the investigators they lacked imagination when Pi claimed he couldn't \"imagine\" a bonsai tree since he's never seen one, as a way of mocking the investigators' reluctance to believe in Pi's carnivorous island. (Nice cultural stereotyping with the bonsai, by the way -- the investigators are Japanese.) But you see the problem, right? It's not a matter of lacking imagination. It's a matter of conflating things that are obviously imaginary with things that are obviously real. They're not one and the same. It's ludicrous to suggest otherwise. You might as well say that the story of Frodo and the Ring is every bit as real as the American Revolution.Pi also tells us, quite pointedly, that choosing agnosticism is immobilizing, while atheists and religious folks make a courageous leap of faith. Yet immobility is precisely where Pi places us, so that by the time the book ends, you're stuck not knowing what to think about what you've just read. Do you accept the original shipwreck story just because it's more engrossing, even if it's less believable? Or do you accept the plausible but boring story Pi gives to the officials after he's rescued? Fanciful religious allegories or cold, scientific recitation of facts that might come from the mouth of an atheist -- we're expected to pick one or the other.But it's a false dichotomy. We needn't make a choice between embracing religious tales merely because they're more interesting or settling for the sobering realities of science and reason. We can go as far as our reason will take us and then leave ourselves open to further possibilities -- just as Pi himself suggests. That's not immobility. That's intellectual honesty -- an admission that I don't know all the answers but am willing to keep an open mind about whatever else is presented to me.Seems better than saying you might as well just accept the better story since it really makes no difference. That's laziness. And it doesn't make for a very good story."

        "text": "On the surfaceLife of Piis a funny little book, heart-warming and audacious, but dig a little deeper and you\u2019ll see how complex the story actually is.The magically real elements make the story doubt itself; they call into question the probability of these events actually happening because they are so ridiculously unrealistic. As Pi says to those that disbelieve him:\"I know what you want. You want a story that won't surprise you. That will confirm what you already know. That won't make you see higher or further or differently. You want a flat story. An immobile story. You want dry, yeastless factuality.\u201dSuch an assertion questions the truth of fiction. The details aren\u2019t important. Change but a few of them and the journey Pi goes on remains the same. It does not matter if he was trapped on the boat with a bunch of zoo animals or people that reflected the animals in his life, the story remains the same: the truth is not changed. Belief is stretched to absolute breaking point and sometimes it needs to be with a story like this.And such a thing harkens to the religious ideas Pi holds. He practices several religions believing they all serve the same purpose. This never wavers despite the violent and desperate times he eventually faces. And I really did appreciate this idea; it demonstrates unity in a world divided over matters of faith when it should not be. Again, are the details really that important? To a religious zealot such a thing boarders on blasphemy, though the harmony of such an idea speaks for itself in this book.\u201cIf you stumble about believability, what are you living for? Love is hard to believe, ask any lover. Life is hard to believe, ask any scientist. God is hard to believe, ask any believer. What is your problem with hard to believe?\u201dAlthough I disagree with many of the sentiments in this book, sentiments that may belong to Pi as our narrator and perhaps even to the author himself, I appreciated the degree of time taken to clarify them. The stance on religion was an interesting one with disbelief being compared to a lack of movement in one\u2019s life (not something that I see as truth.)Zoos are also described as places of wonderment for animals rich in safety and easy living, which can be true in some cases, though the horrors of bad commercial zoos and the cruelty and exploitation that go with them are completely ignored. For me, this is not a point that can be overlooked in such fiction or in life. To do so is somewhat na\u00efve no matter the good intentions of Pi.I did not loveLife of Pi, I never could, though it is a book that made me think about the purposes of fiction and the power of stories, true or untrue."

I have nothing but the fondest memories of growing up in a zoo. I lived the life of a prince. What maharaja\u2019s son had such vast, luxuriant grounds to play about? What palace had such a menagerie? My alarm clock during my childhood was a pride of lions.Then one day a hero must embark on the fateful voyage\u2026In the near distance I saw trees. I did not react. I was certain it was an illusion that a few blinks would make disappear.The trees remained. In fact, they grew to be a forest. They were part of a low-lying island. I pushed myself up. I continued to disbelieve my eyes. But it was a thrill to be deluded in such a high-quality way. The trees were beautiful. They were like none I had ever seen before. They had a pale bark, and equally distributed branches that carried an amazing profusion of leaves. These leaves were brilliantly green, a green so bright and emerald that, next to it, vegetation during the monsoons was drab olive.One may lie beautifully for hours while it takes just few brief moments to tell the sorrowful truth."

        "text": "[Revised, pictures and shelves added 2/28/23]For years I noticed this book on display, particularly its cartoonish paperback cover. Was it a children's book? This Pi stuff -- was it something about math? (Was it plagiarized? See story at end.)It's a castaway story and like all castaway and shipwreck stories it's about human endurance, indomitable spirit and man vs. nature. The things that distinguish this story from Robinson Crusoe or Tom Hanks in the movie Cast Away, is that the main character (Pi, short for Piscine) is trapped in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger.Pi is Indian and he's multi-religious - a true believer in Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism. He comes from a family of zookeepers who were transporting their animals by freighter. This is how he wound up with a tiger in his lifeboat.It's an inspiring book, but drags in spots -- more than 200 days at sea is a lot of fish and storm stories. I kept waiting for the multi-religious theme to play a real role in the story but it did so only peripherally, so the plot seems a bit disconnected from that theme.In the end, we are offered two stories: one of murder and cannibalism and one of a journey in the lifeboat with animals. A key line comes at the end of the book as a throwaway: 'Which story do you prefer? So it is with God.' It's a decent read and an interesting plot but as I revise this review, with hindsight, I'm downgrading my rating from 4 to 3.Life of Pi won the 2002 Booker prize and was a huge seller worldwide \u2013 12 million copies and 1.5 million ratings on GR. But here\u2019s a story I came across when I reviewed another book, The Strange Nation of Rafael Mendes, by Brazilian Jewish author Moacyr Scliar. Here\u2019s the (paraphrased) story from the NY Times obituary for Scliar in 2011 and from Wikipedia:Scliar wrote a novel, Max and the Cats, about a Jewish youth who flees Nazi Germany on a ship carrying wild animals to a Brazilian zoo. After a shipwreck the boy ends up sharing a lifeboat with a jaguar. The book achieved fame twice over. Critically praised on its publication in 1981, it touched off a literary storm in 2002 when the Canadian writer Yann Martel (b. 1963) won the Man Booker Prize for Life of Pi, about an Indian youth trapped on a boat with a tiger. Mr. Martel\u2019s admission that he borrowed the idea led to an impassioned debate among writers and critics on the nature of literary invention and the ownership of words and images. Martel admitted he got the idea by reading a review of Scliar\u2019s book but said he never read the book itself. \u201cIn a certain way I feel flattered that another writer considered my idea to be so good, but on the other hand, he used that idea without consulting me or even informing me,\u201d Mr. Scliar told The NY Times. \u201cAn idea is intellectual property.\u201dTop image is a still from the movie on npr.orgThe author from theguardian.co.uk"

        "text": "People often see me walking down the street, casually, minding my own business, and they always stop and ask me, \"Yo, Justin, what are you reading these days?\"And I'm always happy to stop and engage in conversation about what I'm reading, and I share a few thoughts about the book.\"Yeah, it's not bad. Pretty good so far.\"\"Really enjoying it! Better than I expected!\"\"Oh man, it's alright I guess. Kinda slow.\"I like to keep my comments pretty general in nature.Also, that never actually happens to me.Or does it?Anyway, I did tell a few people I was reading Life of Pi and every single one of them said, \"Oh yeah, isn't that the book about the guy and a tiger on a raft?\" Because that's what everyone thinks of when they think of Life of Pi. The book about some guy on a boat with a tiger. And they are absolutely right. I mean, if you needed a one sentence synopsis of Life of Pi you would say it's about some dude floating around on a raft or a boat or something with a tiger, and that would be it. You nailed it.Except Pi isn't on a lifeboat with Richard Parker (the tiger) until about halfway through the book. So that synopsis isn't enough because there is so much more going on in Life of Pi. So much more.So let's start with the biggest reason this book gets a coveted five star rating from me: I got to learn all about zoos and the animals that inhabit them. I'm kidding, a little, kind of, but the beginning of the book is just fascinating to read. Pi weaves in stories of his childhood with facts about India, religion, animals, zoos, family, and all kinds of other stuff. One scene in particular that I loved was when Pi was trying to determine his religion and the choice that follows. Just humorous, insightful stuff all around, and I forgot all about what the book is really about. I won't remind you.The story moves from all of that stuff, like a memoir I guess, to an adventure story. Now, I'm not a huge adventure story kind of guy, but the writing was so engaging and the audiobook narration was so intoxicating that I kept plugging along with all the craziness Pi finds himself in. It gets pretty violent and a little disgusting at times, but you're reading about wild animals and about a guy who is caught in a horrible tale of survival. It's not too bad.Then, the end of the book comes along, and oh my god I can't even tell you about the end of the book. It's awesome though. Just trust me on this one if you haven't read it already. You've probably read it already. You've probably seen the movie, too, you awesome person you. Look at you go, all awesome and stuff.I'm gonna watch the movie as soon as possible. Looking forward to it. This was a fantastic audiobook that I spent almost a month listening to during my morning commute. Whatever I pop in next has a tough act to follow.January has been a pretty solid month of reading for me. Definitely ended it on a high note. I don't rate books five stars very often because I'm am overly critical book critic, but this is a five star read that deserves a little bit of your time."

        "text": "\u2019 Life is a peephole, a single tiny entry onto a vastness.\u2019We have all heard the phrase \u2018you can\u2019t judge a book by it\u2019s cover.\u2019 While this is a good life lesson, especially when taken as a metaphor that extends beyond books and into people, places, foods, etc., sometimes the cover of a novel is very telling of what lies within. Yann Martel\u2019sLife of Piwears it\u2019s heart on it\u2019s sleeve. A quick glance at the cover shows the overzealous stamp of \u2018Winner of the Man Booker Prize\u2019,INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER, the indication that, yes, this is \u2018A Novel\u2019, and an image that both depicts the major plot point of the novel, thus spoiling the surprise of who Richard Parker really is. All this praise lauded upon the cover is instantly telling that this is a novel that has reached a wide audience, and is most likely aimed towards wide critical acclaim. That is all fine, and bravo to Mr. Martel for being able to leave his mark on the bestseller list, something I can only imagine in my wildest of wildest dreams, but sometimes when reaching for a large audience you have to elbow out a small percentage of readers. I am that small percentage that was elbowed out by Martel\u2019s attempt to make an accessible novel that will touch the reader on a spiritual level. This is a difficult novel to review as, firstly, I did enjoy reading the book. I gave in to reading this book that I have been purposely avoiding after reading the excellentreviewfrom mi Hermana. I had a lot of fun discussing this book with her, texting her my shocks and suprises in the plot, and discussing the book in several threads with fellow Goodreaders. As anyone can see with a quick glance at the overall ratings, this book seems to really strike a chord in many readers, yet also brings a large crowd of dissenters. While I did extract a good deal of pleasure from the novel, it just didn\u2019t sit well with me at the same time. In all fairness to the novel, and to my usual reading list, I have to dissect this book with the same views of novels that I would any other. This begs the question as to \u2018why do we read?\u2019, and this reason differs from person to person much like each persons meaning of life \u2013 a theme explored in Pi.Life of Piwas a pleasurable read that suffered from a heavy-handed serving of morality. While Martel delivers one charming phrase after the next with a graceful flow, he would have greatly benefited from a touch of subtlety.All to often, Martel would draw conclusions for the reader. A prime example occurs in the first few pages when Pi\u2019s science teacher visits the Zoo (a zoo that he does not hold back from explaining how it serves as a metaphor for humanity), and calls out the name of well-known scientists whose studies pertain to the activities of the animals he is currently viewing. Martel spoils the moment by explaining that Mr. Kumar liked to prove to himself \u2018that everything was order\u2019. It felt as if Martel didn\u2019t believe his readers could connect the dot. Even more obscure ideas are spoiled in such a manner. When a rain of flying fish saves Pi and Richard Parker from certain hunger, he thanks Vishnu saying \u2018once you saved the world by taking the form of a fish. Now you have savedmeby taking the form of a fish\u2019. While I would not have made this connection, it ruins that \u2018ah-ha!\u2019 moment for those that do. It is that special moment of understanding an allusion in literature that keeps me reading a wide variety of texts, and it seems insulting to have someone to make connections without giving you an opportunity. Even at the very end, in his shocking twist of an ending (I must profess this novel has an incredible conclusion), the two Chinese men literally draw the connections for you saying something to the effect of \u2018oh, this is this and that means that\u2026\u2019. This all seems to be Martel\u2019s way of making sure his message gets heard, and is able to reach everyone. It is a noble goal, and it gets people who do not typically read to like and enjoy a book, so I cannot necessarily knock him for it as that was his goal, but this is all to my chagrin.\u2018It's important in life to conclude things properly,\u2019 Pi explains, \u2018only then can you let go. Otherwise you are left with words you should have said but never did, and your heart is heavy with remorse\u2019. The question now is, does Martel conclude things properly? I personally loved the conclusion to this book. He successfully pulls the rug out from under the reader and exposes the real message behind the book. Without spoiling anything, this novel makes a good statement on the powers of storytelling with both a fun plot device and well crafted statements such as \u2018that's what fiction is about, isn't it, the selective transforming of reality? The twisting of it to bring out its essence?\u2019 Had he left it at that, it would have been wonderful and allowed for mass interpretability and the reader could have easily connected it to spirituality. However, Martel forces the connection to religion down the reader\u2019s throat. The whole beginning section of the novel, which details Pi\u2019s exploration of various religions, seems irrelevant for the majority the novel. Occasionally he will pray or include some stunning statements on the beauty of life and the grace of God/gods, but it seems to have been only there to make sure you were looking for the religious metaphors in the plot and comes across as Martel with a death grip on the readers head, jerking it back and forth shouting \u2018look here! Notice that! Remember what we talked about!?\u2019 While much of the focus on spirituality was well done, it was far too heavy-handed and led to a rather narrow interpretation on the ending.My major concern is that Martel only gave us what he thought the reader would want, making quotes such as \u2018I know what you want. You want a story that won\u2019t surprise you. That will confirm what you already know. That won\u2019t make you see higher or further or differently,\u2019 seem like he wasn\u2019t being as ironic with the ending as he hoped it would be. While the conclusion comes out as \u2018bet you didn\u2019t see that coming\u2019, it really doesn\u2019t say anything that hasn\u2019t been said before. The novel is heralded as being an affirmation of faith, and that\u2019s exactly what it is, an affirmation. It isn\u2019t going to challenge your beliefs, although he does an excellent job allowing different religious figures to challenge the differences in belief of one another even if it is the same concepts anyone would learn in a 100 level humanities course; it isn\u2019t going to convert any readers to a life of devotion; it only provides a blanket and a comfort to those that already believe. Which, once again, is not a bad thing, if that is what you are looking for. It reminded me of something a professor once told me in a World Religions course. He described church as something that, and this ishisopinion, is a crutch for those who needed it. He compared the obligation to attend to telling a girlfriend you only hang out with them because you feel you have to and are obligated to. While his opinion is a bit harsh and easily offensive, what he was really trying to say is you should believe because youwantto, not because youhaveto. Martel makes it seem like you have to believe in these things, and I see why that makes this book hard to swallow for someone who doesn\u2019t. Once again, in hopes to reassure and reach a large audience, Martel rudely elbows out the remainder. However, I really feel uncomfortable discussing beliefs on the open seas of the internet, and I really hope nothing said here offends you as that is not my intention. Please understand I am only speaking in relevance to my thoughts on a book, not on religion. The insistence of Martel to wrap a cool concept with spirituality is a major reason why it is so difficult to talk about this book. It is hard to separate the two ideas, but I\u2019m doing my best to keep this focused on the literary aspects. I\u2019m getting too self-conscious! The whole point here is that a lot of what Martel says has been said before, better, and with more willingness to evoke a change in the reader.All that said, there is a lot that I truly enjoyed about this book. If you push all the aforementioned details aside, this was a wild ride. This made me want to visit zoos and hug a tiger. Look how cute this tiger is:Tell me you don\u2019t want to hug that! I really enjoyed the wealth of zoological knowledge Martel bestows upon the reader, and his insistence on seeming \u2018realistic\u2019 with his animals. After reading this book, you will know why you shouldnever, evertry to hug a tiger or take a wild animal for granted. He makes an interesting point how we force cute cuddly animal toys on children and make them think they are some domestic pet. While this is used as an excellent point that humans are the villain, which is easily slotted into the religious issues as an explanation that it isn\u2019t religion that causes violence but the people abusing the rhetoric, it does seem ironically opposed to his final statement of how religion glosses over the grimy, difficult to handle details of life and makes it easier to handle. Are cute cuddly animal toys then religion? This novel is a very positive message to the world, and anything promoting peace and harmony can\u2019t be all that bad. I enjoyed statements such as \u2018If there's only one nation in the sky, shouldn't all passports be valid for it?\u2019, which is an important idea considering the violence that takes place around the world. I also enjoyed how the animal story is also chock full of scientific facts and details, which fuses the idea of religion and science together instead of showing them as opposites. Thre were some symbolism, the ones he left untainted by a forced explanation, that really struck me. The tiger itself is open for many views, either as God, Pi, or life itself - something we must face and tame lest it destroy us. However, could it be the killer inside us all, an urge and animalistic force we must keep in check in order to exist in a civilized society? In a way, I felt that the ending could almost be an attack on religion, showing it as nothing more than a pretty way of viewing a world as ugly as our own. I felt that the tarpauline served as a similar symbol. It was a feeling of security, something to stand on, but underneath was the violent truth of a deadly tiger. Perhaps it was our personal sense of security which is actually just thin and flimsy. When Martel doesn't slap us with his meaning, it is quite good.I was simply not the intended audience for this novel. However, Martel has a positive message that he wanted to reach a wide audience in hopes to spread peace to a world badly in need of it, so I cannot be too harsh on him. He achieved his goals for the novel, but his novel did not reach my goals for literature. Still, this was a fun read and I would recommend it. Just ask yourself, \u2018why read?\u2019 and if the cons of this review outweigh the pros, then this novel is not for you. But if you desire something that will entertain, broaden your horizons of spirituality if you don\u2019t know much about various religions, or reaffirm your faith, well look no further.3.5/5\u2018Life is so beautiful that death has fallen in love with it, a jealous possessive love that grabs at what it can.\u2019Here's more tigers. Because you deserve them:"

In the most desperate of circumstances, while Pi is on his lifeboat with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker, imagination and storytelling are the keys to Pi's incredible story of survival. Issues about believability, what really happened on the boat, take a backseat to wonder, love, creativity and to a certain extent, madness. The novel is heavy on spirituality, but it is compelling and Pi's evolving relationship with Richard Parker keeps their 227 days at sea interesting."

In reality, this book is an examination of faith in all its forms. Young Pi loves God, and to prove it he becomes Christian and Muslim in addition to his native Hinduism. He also loves animals, and much of the book examines animal psychology and its relationship to human psychology in a vibrant, interesting way.This book had me asking questions about my life, my beliefs, and my society on just about every page....and when the reader gets to the end (which I won't spoil here), the reader is forced to ask themself the kind of person they really are. If ever there was a novel that could be called a litmus test, it's this one. \"The Life of Pi\" will, at the very least, entertain through its sharp storytelling, but it can also help a reader examine how they see the world - and isn't that the point of great literature?Favorite quotes:\"I felt a kinship with him. It was my first clue that atheists are my brothers and sisters of a different faith, and every word they speak speaks of faith. LIke me, they go as far as the legs of reason will carry them - and then they leap.\"\"But I don't insist. I don't mean to defend zoos. Close them all down if you want (and let us hope that what wildlife remains can survive in what is left of the natural world). I know zoos are no longer in people's good graces. Religion faces the same problem. Certain illusions about freedom plague them both.\"\"And so, when she first heard of Hare Krishnas, she didn't hear right. She heard 'hairless Christians', and that is what they were to her for many years. When I corrected her, I told her that in fact she was not so wrong; that Hindus, in their capacity for love, are indeed hairless Christians, just as Muslims, in the way they see God in everything, are bearded Hindus, and Christians, in their devotion to God, are hat-wearing Muslims.\"\"Christianity is a religion in a rush. Look at the world created in seven days. Even on a symbolic level, that's creation in a frenzy. To one born in a religion where the battle for a single soul can be a relay race run over many centuries, with innumerable generations passing along the baton, the quick resolution of Christianity has a dizzying effect. If Hinduism flows placidly like the Ganges, then Christianity bustles like Toronto at rush hour. It is a religion as swift as a swallow, as urgent as an ambulance. It turns on a dime, expresses itself in the instant. In a moment, you are lost or saved. Christianity stretches back through the ages, but in essence it exists only at one time: right now.\""

Not because I didn\u2019t loveLife of Pi, because I absolutely did, but because it is difficult to put into words where this incredible tale has taken me.Throughout the reading, I have found myself utterly horrified and fascinated in equal measure. I can honestly say I\u2019ve never pondered life, religion, survival - and how far a human can be pushed - as deeply as I have since I began my journey with Piscine Molitor Patel. I questioned faith and contemplated how far it could carry someone who's hanging on by a thread. I asked myself if I could have survived even half of what Pi had endured? Probably not, but who knows how strong the will to live is until it's put to the test? This is undoubtedly a book that gave me pause for thought.Nature is as volatile as it is beautiful and, as an animal lover, I must warn those who might be disturbed by scenes of savagery (i.e. the natural order of life and death as it exists in the animal kingdom).This story is dazzling, funny, gruesome, allegorical and altogether unforgettable.Life of Piis a powerful read."

I was keen to see how the author could pull this off.But pull it off he did, taking me back to a wondrous childhood of adventure tales and fables.And you are welcome to whack me over the head with a leather-bound copy of War and Peace, but I am such a sucker for exotic book covers!Please read the book, don't see the film: Ditto, Captain Corelli."

        "text": "This is not a story of a boy and his BFF tiger.This is nothing likeCalvin and Hobbes.The tiger is nothing like Tigger or Lassie.This is not a YA book.That is worth pointing out I think, because themovieposter and trailer gave me this impression.This book has teeth.My initial thoughts onLife of Piis that it is a book that demands to be read slowly due to a rambling nonlinear narrative in the first few chapters. Actually it is not, it can be read fairly quickly once you hit your stride with it. Any way, the novel got off to a slow start for me though I found the intro \"Author's Notes\" immediately appealing. Initially I was also a bit confused about which part is narrated by the author and which by Piscine \"Pi\" Molitor Patel\u200e the book's protagonist. That sorts itself out after a while as I settled into the author's narrative style and the book's structure. There are some expositions about about running a zoo and animal psychology which I find very interesting. I certainly know some people who believe zoos are immoral and all the caged animals should be set free, this book presents a plausible case for why this may not be such a good idea and that the animals are unlikely to be grateful to the liberators. I am not normally a fan of infodumps, but these expositions are affably written and mostly non-technical.Once the main part of the story begins, where poor Pi is cast away on a life boat with some wild animals the books becomes very engaging and I was devouring his adventure and could not wait to find out what happen next. The ocean adventure part of the book is really a riveting read. As Pi settles into his life on the life boat the book becomes trippy and metaphysical in parts. If you read online discussions about this book you will find several interpretation of what it all means and what really transpires in the book. To go into too much detail about this ambiguous aspect of the book would risk spoiling the book for potential readers, suffice to say that the book left me with plenty of food for thought which is still swirling in my head as I write.Art by Neanderthal-JamThere are elements of humour scattered throughout the book, the style of humor tend to be fairly subtle, my favorite humorous scene involves three bickering wise men and a boy of multiple faiths. I also love how the major supporting character Richard Parker came by his name. My favorite aspect of the book is the prose style which is lyrical, accessible and generally very pleasant to read. Here is one of my favorite passages:\"I will not die. I refuse it. I will make it through this nightmare. I will beat the odds, as great as they are. I have survived so far, miraculously. Now I will turn miracle into routine. The amazing will be seen every day. I will put in all the hard work necessary. Yes, so long as God is with me, I will not die. Amen.\"Even if you are entirely irreligious you can still appreciate the eloquence of the writing.This book is often classified as a fantasy but I wonder if it is actually more scifi? Some strange places and things are rationalized with scientific assumptions, particularly a mysterious island that appears in the last section of the book. Some people are understandably frustrated and annoyed by the epilogue of the book where everything seems to turn upside down, or not depending on how you want to interpret this part of the book. It surprised the hell out of me but adds to the enjoyment of the book, and I don't think it invalidates anything that goes on in the preceding chapters. Looking at other Goodreads reviewsLife of Piseems to be divisive among its readers. Quite a few people find the book pretentious and not as intelligent or profound as the author presents it to be. They may be on to something, I don't really know. Oftentimes I find the reviewers just as pretentious as the book they are criticizing, is this a case of an eye for an eye? Personally I just wanted it to be entertaining and interesting and it meets these criteria in spades. A little pretentiousness does not bother me as long as the book is a good read.I have no qualms at all about recommending this book, may be you will love it like I do, may be it will make you mad and you will throw it at the wall. I really don't know how it will be for you. Totally worth a shot in my opinion.Art by gluecifer"

As the ocean liner of communism sinks under the weight of its own massive incompetence (a good idea, but the captain was drunk and the crew were sticky-fingered rascals), you leap overboard, clamber on to the only available boat (capitalism) only to find that there's a giant tiger on board which will eat you unless you can keep feeding it your hapless fellow-creatures.When I thought this novel was about God I gave it 2 stars. It didn't make sense. But now I realise - it's a perfect metaphor - three stars."

        "text": "As near as I can say, this should probably be 3.141592654 stars.I was disappointed in this novel, but not really surprised at this. Rather I was somewhat prepared for it, because the ratings for it, specifically by my GR friends andreviewers(people I follow), are all over the place. While over half of these ratings are good (4s and 5s), fully 28% arebad(1s and 2s). This is the highest percent of bad ratings for a Booker award winner since 2000 among these people.And, as indicated by my own rating, there were things I liked about the book. But before I get into any more detail, I will warn readers that there are some mild spoiler type comments in what follows. Most of these are general comments about the structure or message of the book. In one place where I say something very specific about the plot I have used the normal spoiler alert.So \u2026 what I liked about the book was (surprise) probablymostof it. I found the main storyline taking place in the boat not only an enjoyable read, but even quite believable. I would be willing (if most of the novel had been published as an actual memoir by a sea disaster survivor) to believe even the bit about the companion that he survived with. I thought the explanation given of how the relation developed between Pi and his feline companion made enough sense to believe.But there were a number of things about the book that I really disliked.(1) TheAuthor\u2019s Notewhich begins the book is probably something that many readers didn\u2019t even read, since I know some don\u2019t read prefatory material in books. I always read this stuff, and I was quite confused when I read this note. Of course I assumed it was a genuine comment by Martel, but finally realized that it is itself part of the fiction. Besides being confused by this material, I was amazed that the author seemed to be claiming that the story he was about to relate would make me believe in God. But more on that later.(2) Skipping to the other end of the book, the last section, in which Pi is interviewed by the Japanese investigators, struck me first as a very lame attempt at humor (of a rather condescending nature, since it makes these investigators out as complete fools). The way in which Pi is represented as a superior being to these buffoons was more irritating to me than humorous. But the worst part of this section is the alternate story that Pi tells the men when they express disbelief in the story he tells them of his survival. Then, after relating this alternate story, he asks them to believe the one they \u201clike best\u201d. Not the one they think is more probably true, but the one theylike best!And these simpletons take Pi up on his request, decide that theylikehis original story better (no small wonder) and conclude the investigation. Presumably readers are supposed to decide that we too will believe Pi\u2019s story because welikeit better than the grisly alternative? (But again, more on this later.)(3) Several chapters near the end of the sea story seemed weak to me, for various reasons.- Chapter 85 (\u201cOnce there was lightning \u2026\u201d) seems like an obligatory couple hundred words on something that might happen at sea in a lifeboat, but plays no part in the story; rather, it simply provides a setting for Pi to blather on about how the experience of a close lightning strike swept him into paroxysms of wonder about divinity, God, etc. etc.- Chapter 86 relates the (unlikely in the extreme) incident of almost being run over by a gigantic tanker (aimed straight at them from thousands of miles away no doubt), which of course has a crew to whom the lifeboat is entirely invisible.- Chapter 88 (One day we came upon trash \u2026) seems like a meaningless mention of the garbage floating in the Pacific \u2013 but it gives Pi the opportunity to pick up a corked (empty) wine bottle, put a note in it, and launch it back into the ocean and out of the story.- Chapter 89. Now, all of a sudden, the narrative shifts abruptly, with no explanation. Up to this point it has been an interesting survival story, in which Pi is getting along pretty well, Richard Parker has been \u201ctamed\u201d, Pi seems to be having no problem catching both fish and rain water to keep himself and R.P. eating and drinking. All of a sudden he and R.P. are both descending rapidly towards first blindness and then death.- Chapter 90. Here the nonsense really starts. The blind Pi\u2019s boat amazingly bumps intoanother lifeboatbeing rowed byanother blind manin the middle of the Pacific Ocean! This is a rather long chapter, filled with conversation between these two blind men, which I\u2019m afraid went right over my head. The only thing I see it adding to the story is that Pi eventually gets some extra water from this man\u2019s boat, and R.P. gets an extra several meals.- Chapter 92 (\u201cI made an exceptional botanical discovery \u2026\u201d) must be terribly significant, since it goes on for almost 30 pages, and indeed basically concludes the sea portion of the story. This chapter is completely unbelievable, could almost make someone think we are engaged with magical realism. Except it doesn\u2019t feel like that sort of writing. These strange occurrence aren\u2019t \u201cmagical\u201d, they are simply weird, near-but-not-entirely-impossible - or perhaps \u201cdivine\u201d. Perhaps the last two chapters mentioned are meant to introduce a \u201cmiraculous\u201d element into the plot, so that the claim that the story will prompt belief in God can be \u201cdemonstrated\u201d. Anyway, once Pi and R.P. have left this living island, we find them completely resuscitated, sight and health (but not spirit, oddly) restored, and in less than 100 words (Chapter 93) the boat is washing through the surf towards a beach in Mexico.So, in conclusion I\u2019ll make the following observations:1. Much of the story was an enjoyable read for me; but much was irritating, as I\u2019ve explained above. One thing I can be thankful for is that, although I could have spent the time reading any number of books I would have enjoyed more, readingLife of Piat least saved me from spending money on the movie.2. I have to believe that many of the things I found irritating were actually felt to be strong points by the Booker voters. To me, these unusual/irritating aspects of the novel often felt gimmicky. This extends even to the first person narrative, which I think was likely a point in favor of the book\u2019s winning, but which I\u2019m not sure I enjoyed as much as most people apparently did.3. I\u2019m pretty sure that many people who enjoyed the book were helped on that path by their view that the story, somehow or other, made them feel good about their religious outlook. Now this aspect of the book would certainly not appeal to me, but my perception that the book contained those ideas didn\u2019t keep me from reading it. I have no problem with reading fiction about people who have different religious views than mine, and Pi certainly seems to qualify on that count.4. Finally, and commenting further on the last point, I began to wonder, as I was putting this review together, whether Pi\u2019s views of God are actually meant to be admired. Might it not be the fact that the author is, however gently and tactfully, perhaps holding them up to ridicule? I certainly have no idea about the author\u2019s religious beliefs, but for all I know he might not be religious at all. Consider:First, in theAuthor\u2019s Notewe find the assertion (by the fictitious Indian man who tells the tale to the author) that the story will make the author (and us readers by extension) believe in God. Does that mean that the authordoesn\u2019tbelieve in God? And of course, the author of this fiction must know very well that a fiction could not possibly have that effect on a rational person.Second, in the final short chapter before the sea-story ends on the Mexican beach, \u201cPi\u201d writesThe lower you are, the higher your mind will want to soar. It was natural that, bereft and desperate as I was, in the throes of unremitting suffering, I should turn to God.Right, that\u2019s pretty much what Marx said about religion being an opiate. So, is Pi revealing (presumably unintentionally) his real reasons for believing in God?Third, in the final segment with the Japanese investigators, Pi is able to get them to \u201cbelieve\u201d his original story \u201cwith the animals\u201d by simply asking themSo tell me, since it makes no factual difference to you and you can\u2019t prove the question either way, which story do you prefer? Which is the better story, the story with the animals or the story without animals?Mr. Okamoto: That\u2019s an interesting question \u2026Mr. Chiba: The story with animals.Mr. Okamoto:Yes.The story with animals is the better story.Pi: Thank you. And so it goes with God.Thus, the story with God is the better story \u2026 we like it more \u2026 it makes us feel better \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 QED"
